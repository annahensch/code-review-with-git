# Code review with git & R
This is a repository for an internal [SoBA lab](https://www.soba-lab.com/) tutorial on how to do code review with git with some slides and a little R-script to practice code review. On top of our own crash course, we are also showcasing some resources that we have found useful in learning how to use git with R.  

For this introduction to code review with git and R, we are making a few assumptions.  
* You use R/ R projects in your scientific practice.
* You have heard of Github & using Github for version control.
* You want to learn how to improve your workflow by reviewing the scientific code you produce.

## Why should you do code review?
It is helpful to think of code review as being one small part in "transitioning your workflow". I first started thinking about this when I heard the talk of the same name by Danielle Navarro at the Research Bazaar Sydney in 2019: https://slides.com/djnavarro/workflow#/  

Danielle is a computational cognitive scientist at the University of New South Wales. In her talk, she argues that to help future you, you can make some small changes in your scientific workflow. By using tools such as R (for data analysis), OSF (for pre-registration and data sharing), git/ Github (for version contorl & code review) and PsyArXiv (for sharing pre-prints), we can improve the overall quality of our science.

## Intro to git - the unloved sibling of code review
According to Danielle "learning git is one of the hardest steps. We all go through this stage... and that's OKAY!" (see link to slides above).

Indeed, git is hard, but the feeling of finally using git commands in the shell (the terminal on your PC or Mac) is unlike any other coding win I have ever experienced! And you can feel the joy, too!  

Having been through a lot of online resources, we've found the following YouTube tutorial most helpful for figuring out using Git Bash (that is using git via the shell):

To get a better understanding of how git actually works, we strongly recommend this recent R-Ladies talk by Bruna Wundervald: http://brunaw.com/slides/git-workshop/git-workshop.html#1
